inherited syphilis.

movement occurs; swelling is most marked in the vicinity of the joint,
and it may be added to by effusion into the synovial cavity. The baby,

The lesions met with later correspond to those of the tertiary period of
the acquired disease, but as they affect bones which are still actively
