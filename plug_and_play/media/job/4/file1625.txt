lancinating twinges. Should doubt remain as to the presence of pus,
recourse may be had to the use of an exploring needle.

frequently arises is to decide whether or not pus has actually formed.

inflammation has lasted for four or five days without showing signs of
abatement, suppuration has almost certainly occurred. In deep-seated

#Treatment of Acute Abscesses.#--The dictum of John Bell, "Where there
