It will be evident that too much reliance must not be placed upon a

a series of observations should be made, the blood being examined about

The clinical significance of the blood count in individual diseases will

septic poisonings, in pneumonia, and in cancerous growths associated
with ulceration, a certain number of the polynuclear leucocytes are
