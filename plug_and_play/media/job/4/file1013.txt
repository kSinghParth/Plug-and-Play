each to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming

veterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a

1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In
twenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to
almost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from
