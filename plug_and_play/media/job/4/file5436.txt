Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful
perplexity. The countess and Sonya cried from pity for Natasha and

own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion
which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of
the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in
their presence.
