"No," she replied, but she had not understood his question.

"Forgive me!" he said. "But you are so young, and I have already

"Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be," continued
Prince Andrew, "it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask

remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or
should you come to love..." said Prince Andrew with an unnatural
smile.
