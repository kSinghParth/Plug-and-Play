excuses now! It's your turn to sing the ba'cawolla--I entweat you!"

"What is the matter?" she asked.

room where the clavichord stood.

Sonya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to
Denisov's favorite barcarolle. Natasha was preparing to sing.
Denisov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.
