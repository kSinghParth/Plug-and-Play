in which organisms may lodge. They are next washed for three minutes in
methylated spirit to dehydrate the skin, and then for two or three

Finally, the hands are rubbed with dry sterilised gauze.

Immediately before the operation the skin is again purified in the same

The _iodine method_ of disinfecting the skin introduced by Grossich is
