spraying with peroxide of hydrogen.

The antitoxic serum is our sheet-anchor in the treatment of diphtheria,

either through the mouth or nose. When this is impracticable, nutrient

In laryngeal diphtheria, the interference with respiration may call for

has greatly diminished the number of cases in which it becomes necessary
to have recourse to these measures.

Intubation consists in introducing through the mouth into the larynx a
