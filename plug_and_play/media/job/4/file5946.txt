twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally

if you formed a secret society and began working against the
government--be it what it may--I know it is my duty to obey the
government. And if Arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you
and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.'
And you may argue about that as you like!"

An awkward silence followed these words. Natasha was the first to

was weak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was

last remark.
