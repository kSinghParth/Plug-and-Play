The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."

I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
